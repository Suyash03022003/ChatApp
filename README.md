The project shown on your screen contains three components, i.e., Header, Messenger, Footer.

The Header component is build with a svg image containing a group of users, heading section, and a svg image of options.

The messenger component is build with various different components, i.e., it contains a main messenger.js which is mapping the data inside data.js with the cards (MeCard and UserCard) using map() function. The two files, Mecard.js and UserCard.js contains the structure of the cards i.e., message containers, and it is simply returned in messenger.js. The messenger.js files sends props to those two files and which are used for fetching data into their cards respectively.

This is all about the working of the applications.

Thank You
